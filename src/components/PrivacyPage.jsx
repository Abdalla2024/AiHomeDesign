            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              AI Home Design is designed with privacy by default. We do not collect, process,
              or transmit your personal data to our servers. All app data stays
              on your device unless you explicitly choose to share it.
            </p>

            <h2>Data We Handle</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Content you create</strong>: Stored locally on your device using Apple
                technologies (SwiftData) and small preferences via <code>UserDefaults</code> for things like
                design history and style preferences.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Generated images</strong>: Created using on-device workflows and/or third‑party APIs you invoke from the app. When you share an image, it is
                exported to a temporary file and shared via the iOS share sheet. We do not receive a copy.
              </li>

              <li>No analytics, advertising identifiers, or tracking technologies</li>
              <li>No third‑party SDK telemetry (e.g., no Firebase, Crashlytics, Sentry, etc.)</li>
              <li>No account system and no server-side storage</li>

            <h2>Backups and Sync</h2>
            <p>
              Your device may back up app data (including invoices) as part of your iOS backup settings
              (e.g., iCloud device backup) if enabled at the system level. These backups are managed by Apple
              under your iCloud settings. The app itself does not transmit data to any developer-controlled server.

            <h2>Permissions</h2>
            <p>
               The app may request access to the camera or photo library solely for selecting or capturing room photos you choose. It operates in the
               iOS sandbox and only reads files you choose.

            <h2>Data Control and Deletion</h2>

              <li>You can delete invoices within the app.</li>
              <li>Deleting the app removes all locally stored data from your device.</li>
              <li>To remove data from backups, manage your iCloud/device backups in iOS settings.</li>
